1. Project Setup

Initialize Project:

Set up a React.js project.

Install necessary dependencies: react-router-dom, axios, styled-components, json-server, bcryptjs for encryption, and any other necessary libraries.

Set Up JSON Server:
Create a db.json file to store users and recipes.
Configure the JSON server to serve data from db.json.

2. Routing

Set Up Routing:
Use react-router-dom to create routes for the Login, Registration, Home, and Profile Pages.
Implement protected routes to restrict access to certain pages based on user authentication status.

3. User Management

Registration Page:
Form:
Collect user details: Name, Surname, Email, Username, Password, Profile Picture.
Password Encryption:
Encrypt the password before sending it to the server.

API Call:
POST /users: Add new user data to JSON server.

Login Page:

Form:
Collect Username and Password.

Password Decryption:
Compare encrypted password with the stored one.

API Call:
GET /users: Verify user credentials.

Authentication:
If valid, set user session and redirect to the Home Page.

Profile Page:

View Profile:
Display user information.
Allow users to update their profile information.

Update Profile:
PATCH /users/:id: Update user details on the server.
Update login credentials if necessary.

4. Recipe Management
Home Page:
Display Recipes:
Fetch and display all recipes from the JSON server.
Implement search functionality for filtering recipes by name or category.
Group recipes by categories (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, etc.).

Add Recipe:

Form:
Input fields for Recipe Name, Ingredients, Instructions, Category, Preparation Time, Cooking Time, Servings.

API Call:
PATCH /recipes/:id or PUT /recipes/:id: Update recipe on the JSON server.

Delete Recipe:
API Call:
DELETE /recipes/:id: Remove a recipe from the JSON server.

5. Data Management
Persistence:
Ensure all user and recipe data is stored in db.json via the JSON server.

Performance:

Optimization:
Implement lazy loading, memoization, and other techniques to ensure fast loading and smooth performance.

Privacy & Security:

User Data Protection:

Ensure user passwords are encrypted.
Use secure HTTP methods and validate user input.
Protect sensitive routes and data according to best practices.

6. User Interface (UI)

Responsive Design:
Implement a responsive layout to support various screen sizes.

UI Components:
Design intuitive components for forms, recipe cards, navigation, etc.

Styled-Components:
Utilize styled-components to manage CSS.

7. Deployment

Host the App:
Deploy the React app and JSON server to a platform like Vercel or Netlify.

Ensure Security:
Secure the backend and ensure data protection compliance.

8. Testing
Test Components:
Implement unit tests for key components and functions.
End-to-End Testing:
Test the full user flow from registration to recipe management.
